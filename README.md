### Avocado sales
The Hass Avocado Board has data on years of avocado sale and there was direction from Kaggle from whose data I wanted to make a sales report.

Over major cities in the US, 4 billion avocadoes were sold each year from 2015 to 2018.

The average price for an avocado for those years stayed in the $1.10 to $1.18 range for those that are conventional. Almost double, or more accurately, 50% more, was what someone could expect to pay for organic in 2015, then 34% more in 2018. In 2023, I still find it hard to buy avocadoes organic and am waiting for the price difference to continue decreasing. Overall, the prices grow slowly, good news to those who eat avocadoes regularly.

The area that consumes the most avocadoes is not by state or a metropolitan area as there are some larger regions mixed in with cities. The West as I would expect, California where some are grown, is the largest consumer. Mostly the top areas such as New York and PhoenixTucson have high population or are geographically close to the border and California.

While the price of an avocado over years 2015 to 2018 remained almost the same, consumption increases steadily by the millions each year. For how many years will Americans eat avocadoes?

This time, I messed with formatting charts for a dashboard on Excel. There is much more to learn and a bit more fun in the basics of data analytics.
